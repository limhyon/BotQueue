    <h3>Okay, so what does that mean?</h3>
    <p>
      Simple.  BotQueue lets you control multiple 3D printers through the Internet and turn them into your own manufacturing center.  Think cloud-based computing, but for making things in the real world.  Now you can build the robot army you've always dreamed of!  Oh yeah, and its 100% open source because that's how I roll.
