		<h2>How Do I Get Started?</h2>

		<h4>Prerequisites:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>A reliable 3D printer.  BotQueue is designed for printing dozens or hundreds of jobs.</li>
			<li>An automated 3D printer.  You should not need to touch your machine after hitting print until the job is done.</li>
			<li>A 3D printer running supported software like GRBL, Sprinter, Marlin, or MakerBot 5D (eg. Replicator)</li>
			<li>Mac or Linux preferred.  Never been tested on Windows.  Likely broken. Testers/Devs wanted.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Step 1: Register an account</h4>
		<p>Visit the <a href="/register">register</a> page and sign up.</p>


		<h4>Step 2: Register your Bots</h4>
		<p>
			On the botqueue.com website, <a href="/bot/register">register a new bot</a>.  Give it a unique name.  If you want to use the integrated Slic3r support, you'll need to choose the slic3r version and upload your config.  From slic3r, click File-&gt;Export Config.  Upload that as your slice config.  Once you do that, you can upload STL files directly to the site and they will be sliced before printing.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Step 3: Download BumbleBee, the client software</h4>
		<p>Download the <a href="http://dl.botqueue.com/bumblebee">official release</a> or run the cutting edge client from <a href="https://github.com/Hoektronics/BotQueue">git</a>.</p>

		<h4>Step 4: Authorize the client software</h4>
		<p>From the command line, navigate to the <strong>bumblebee</strong> folder and run this command: <strong>python bumblebee.py</strong></p>
		<p>It should spawn a web browser and take you to the BotQueue.com page where you authorize the app to access your account.  Take the code it gives you and enter it into the terminal.</p>

		<h4>Step 5: Configure your bots</h4>
		<p>
			  Now, edit the <strong>bumblebee/config.json</strong> file and modify the file with your particular bot information.  After you modify this file, you will need to restart the client software by quitting and re-running it.
		</p>
		<p>
		  You can exit it by hitting <strong>q</strong> or <strong>Ctrl+c</strong>.  Re-start it by running <strong>python bumblebee.py</strong>.  This is required because it only pulls down the list of bots from the botqueue.com website once, during the startup of the program.

		<h5>A typical RepRap configuration with 2 machines might look like this:</h5>
    <div class="alert alert-info">
      <strong>Please note:</strong> the worker name must exactly match the name of the bot you registered on the website, or the client software will not attempt to control the machine.  The reason for this is that you can use multiple machines to control different bots (for example you have 10 machines in one room, and 10 machines in another room, each with their own control computer)
    </div>

<pre>{
 "app": {
  "consumer_secret": "ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff", 
  "consumer_key": "ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff", 
  "token_secret": "ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff", 
  "token_key": "ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff"
 }, 
 "workers": [
	{
		"name": "MendelMax",
		"driver" : "printcore",
		"port" : "/dev/tty.usbmodem123",
		"baud" : "250000"
	},
	{
		"name": "Prusa",
		"driver" : "printcore",
		"port" : "/dev/tty.usbmodem345",
		"baud" : "250000"
	}
 ]
}</pre>

		<h4>Step 6: Upload a job to BotQueue</h4>
		<p>
			You can <a href="/upload">upload STL or GCode files to the site</a> and then they will be automatically downloaded and sliced.  Warning: If your client software is running, it will automatically download and process jobs.
		</p>

		<h4>Step 7: Enjoy watching your bot work.</h4>
		<p>
			You now have a network linked 3D printer with a print queue.  It will make you things.  Sit back and enjoy.  I recommend a cold one.
		</p>

		<h4>Step 8: Removing a print upon completion</h4>
		<p>
			When a job is complete is done, you must go to the Botqueue site to go through the output verification (QA) process. It will request that you remove the print and confirm that the print was successful.  If it is not successful, the bot will go offline and not take any more jobs.  If the print is successful, the bot will look at the queue for new jobs, grab the next available one, and immediately begin printing it.

		<h2>Getting Help</h2>
		<p>
			This project is a labor of love by yours truly, <a href="http://www.zachhoeken.com">Zach Hoeken</a>. Both the website and client code are 100% open source.
		</p>
		<p>It is also a new project, so it will probably be buggy.  If you are stuck and can't get it working, try some of the places below for help.  If you're a dev and don't mind getting your hands dirty, I would love to take commits and pull requests.
